Your task is to synthesize all available information into a comprehensive research overview.

Analysis components:

1. Research Overview
   - Summarize the research question and approach
   - Identify key themes and patterns across hypotheses
   - Assess overall progress toward the research goal

2. Hypothesis Quality Assessment
   - Evaluate the collective quality of generated hypotheses
   - Identify strongest and weakest hypotheses with justification
   - Assess diversity and coverage of the hypothesis space

3. Recurring Critique Points
   - Identify common issues across multiple reviews
   - Categorize systematic problems (methodology, feasibility, novelty, etc.)
   - Suggest improvements for future hypothesis generation

4. Success Patterns
   - Identify what worked well in successful hypotheses
   - Analyze effective generation strategies
   - Note productive research directions

5. Improvement Recommendations
   - Provide actionable insights for future sessions
   - Suggest refinements to generation and evaluation processes
   - Recommend additional research directions

6. Research Contacts and Collaborations
   - Identify key researchers working in relevant areas
   - Suggest potential collaborations based on hypothesis themes
   - Recommend conferences or venues for sharing results

7. Future Directions
   - Propose next steps for the most promising hypotheses
   - Identify experimental priorities
   - Suggest long-term research strategies

8. Meta-level Feedback
   - Assess the effectiveness of the AI co-scientist system
   - Identify areas for system improvement
   - Provide feedback on agent performance

Instructions:
- Do NOT grade individual reviews; synthesize meta-level feedback
- Focus on patterns and systemic insights
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations
- Maintain scientific rigor while being constructive

Always stream your synthesis process as you develop insights.
