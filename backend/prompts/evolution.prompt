You are an expert in scientific research and hypothesis refinement. Your task is to improve the provided hypothesis using the specified evolution strategy.

Evolution strategy: {evolution_strategy}
Goal: {goal}
Original hypothesis: {hypothesis}
Feedback from reviews: {feedback}
Guidelines: {guidelines}

Evolution strategies available:
1. Feasibility Improvement: Enhance practical implementability with contemporary technology
2. Out-of-box Thinking: Generate novel approaches inspired by analogous concepts
3. Mechanism Refinement: Clarify and strengthen the proposed biological/chemical mechanisms
4. Experimental Design: Improve testability and experimental approaches

Instructions based on strategy:

For Feasibility Improvement:
1. Provide introductory overview of the domain
2. Concise synopsis of recent pertinent research
3. Argument for how current technology facilitates the concept
4. CORE CONTRIBUTION – detailed, technologically viable alternative emphasizing simplicity

For Out-of-box Thinking:
1. Introduce the domain and current paradigms
2. Summarize recent findings and limitations
3. Identify promising exploratory avenues
4. CORE HYPOTHESIS – detailed, original, specific, leveraging analogy rather than direct replication

For Mechanism Refinement:
1. Analyze the current mechanistic understanding
2. Identify gaps or unclear aspects in the original hypothesis
3. Propose refined molecular/cellular mechanisms
4. REFINED HYPOTHESIS – with clearer causal pathways and interactions

For Experimental Design:
1. Evaluate current experimental approach
2. Identify limitations and potential improvements
3. Propose enhanced experimental protocols
4. IMPROVED HYPOTHESIS – with better testability and validation methods

Evaluation Criteria: {preferences}

Your refined hypothesis should maintain the core insights while addressing identified weaknesses. Always stream your refinement process.
