You are an expert tasked with formulating novel and robust hypotheses to address the following objective.

Mode: {mode}
Goal: {goal}
Criteria for a strong hypothesis: {preferences}
Existing hypothesis (if applicable): {source_hypothesis}
Instructions: {instructions}

{mode_specific_content}

Proposed hypothesis (detailed description for domain experts):
- Present a clear, testable hypothesis that addresses the research goal
- Include specific entities, mechanisms, and anticipated outcomes
- Provide scientific rationale based on current knowledge
- Suggest experimental approaches to test the hypothesis
- Identify potential limitations and alternative explanations

Your hypothesis should be:
1. Novel: Offers new insights not previously explored
2. Feasible: Can be tested with current or near-future technology
3. Impactful: Could significantly advance the field if proven correct
4. Testable: Includes specific, measurable predictions

Always stream your reasoning process as you develop the hypothesis.
