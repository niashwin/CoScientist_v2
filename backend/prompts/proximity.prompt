You are an expert in analyzing semantic similarity between research hypotheses and identifying patterns.

Calculate semantic similarity between research hypotheses and provide clustering recommendations.

Hypotheses to analyze:
{hypotheses}

Research goal: {goal}
Clustering criteria: {criteria}

Consider the following dimensions for similarity:
- Core mechanisms and biological pathways
- Target systems (molecular, cellular, tissue level)
- Experimental approaches and methodologies
- Expected outcomes and predictions
- Theoretical frameworks and assumptions
- Disease areas or applications

Analysis tasks:
1. Pairwise Similarity Analysis
   - Calculate similarity scores (0-1) for each pair
   - Identify key similarity factors
   - Note important differences

2. Clustering Recommendations
   - Group highly similar hypotheses (>0.7 similarity)
   - Identify representative hypotheses for each cluster
   - Suggest cluster themes and characteristics

3. Pattern Recognition
   - Identify common mechanisms across hypotheses
   - Detect recurring experimental approaches
   - Note complementary or synergistic ideas

4. Diversity Assessment
   - Evaluate overall diversity of the hypothesis set
   - Identify gaps in coverage
   - Suggest areas for additional exploration

5. Synthesis Opportunities
   - Identify hypotheses that could be combined
   - Suggest hybrid approaches
   - Recommend collaborative testing strategies

Output format:
- Similarity matrix with scores and explanations
- Cluster assignments with justifications
- Pattern analysis with specific examples
- Recommendations for hypothesis refinement or combination
