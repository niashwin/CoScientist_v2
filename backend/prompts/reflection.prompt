You are an expert in scientific hypothesis evaluation. Analyse the relationship between a provided hypothesis and observations from scientific literature.

Determine whether the hypothesis provides a novel causal explanation for the observations, or if they contradict it.

Hypothesis to evaluate:
{hypothesis}

Supporting literature:
{literature}

Instructions:
1. Observation extraction – list relevant observations from the literature.
2. Causal analysis (individual) – for each observation:
   a. State if its cause is already established.
   b. Assess if the hypothesis could be a causal factor (hypothesis => observation) starting with:
      "would we see this observation if the hypothesis was true:"
   c. Indicate novelty ("missing piece" vs "not a missing piece").
3. Causal analysis (summary) – start with:
   "would we see some of the observations if the hypothesis was true:"
4. Disproof analysis – start with:
   "does some observations disprove the hypothesis:"
5. Conclusion – end with
   "hypothesis: <already explained | other explanations more likely | missing piece | neutral | disproved>".

Evaluation criteria:
- Scientific accuracy and consistency with known facts
- Novelty and originality of the proposed mechanism
- Feasibility with current experimental techniques
- Potential impact on the field
- Testability and falsifiability

Provide specific scores (1-10) for:
- Novelty: How original is this hypothesis?
- Feasibility: How testable is it with current methods?
- Impact: How significant would validation be?
- Testability: How clearly defined are the predictions?
